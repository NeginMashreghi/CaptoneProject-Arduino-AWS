# Captone Project Back End 

# PROJECT

In a simple description our project is attaching the sensors to the Microcontroller (Arduino), passing the data in the database and displaying in the dashboard.

Developing Interface (Dashboard) to display and manage data collecting from with the temperature sensor and future sensor.

Analysing the live data that’s been store every 30 min and storing in the database that’s located in AWS 


## Project Phases

### Phase 1

Set up Arduino and HDT22    

- Researching about Arduino
- Researching about sensor that can give us the Temperature and Humidity
- Figure out how can we connect the sensor to the Arduino
- Figure out how can we code the Arduino to get the data from and sensor

### Phase 2

Set up the Cloud environment   
 
- Researching about Concept of Cloud Computing, Cloud types, and best Cloud platform.
- Researching and set up AWS, and AWS producers that was suitable for or project 
- Researching and set up EC2
- Instal and setup database in EC2 and MySQL workbench

### Phase 3

Sending data Cloud   

- Send/Save the data from Arduino to the database in EC2

## Challenges and Solutions

### Biggest challenges

- Learning curve for understanding Arduino and AWS was really high
- We didn't have enough time to learn everything

### Solution

- Arranging meeting with students and teachers that they have experience with those technology
- Document every step that we accomplish
